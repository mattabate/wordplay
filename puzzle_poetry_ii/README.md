# Puzzle Poetry II

The goal of this study was to find two gramatically correct sentences that use the same letters in the same order, for example

```there also no fun```

```the real son of un```

or

```at end ad```

```a ten dad```

The script is messy but it "works" - only problem is it hasn't turned up anything gramatically correct.
